# SudokuSolver
Certainly! Below are the steps to build a Sudoku solver in C++:

1. **Define the Sudoku Grid Representation**: Decide on a data structure to represent the Sudoku grid. A 2D array or a vector of vectors can be used.

2. **Implement Functions for Input and Output**: Write functions to input a Sudoku puzzle from the user and display the Sudoku grid.

3. **Implement a Function to Check Validity**: Write a function to check if a number placement is valid in a given row, column, and 3x3 subgrid.

4. **Implement the Solve Function**: Write a function to solve the Sudoku puzzle recursively using backtracking.

5. **Compile the Code**: Use a C++ compiler to compile the code.

6. **Run the Executable**: After compiling successfully, run the resulting executable.

These steps provide a basic framework for building a Sudoku solver in C++. You can expand upon these steps and add additional features, such as error handling, performance optimization, and user interface enhancements, based on your requirements.
